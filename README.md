# EDP Library Stages

The **EDP Library Stages** repository describes the specific stages and their realization in frames of a specific pipeline. 
Every stage is presented as an individual Groovy file in a corresponding repository. Such single responsibility 
realization allows rewriting of one essential stage without changing the whole library. 

The [EDP Library Pipelines](https://github.com/epmd-edp/edp-library-pipelines/blob/master/README.md#edp-library-pipelines) repository describes the general structure of the code review, build, and deploy pipelines.
Every pipeline has a set of stages that are consumed from a pipeline`s parameters of a user and can be redefined 
as well. 

If EDP pipelines are not enough for the CICD needs, it is possible to add a custom stage. To do this, a user 
creates the stage, adds it to the application repository, thus extending the EDP Pipelines Framework by customization, 
realization, and redefinition of the user stages. In such a case, the priority goes to the user stages.
